# Sequence Generator and Even Sum Calculator

## Overview

This project is a C++ program that generates a sequence of numbers starting from a given value `a`, with a common difference `d`, until reaching a maximum value `b`. The program also calculates the sum of only the even numbers in the generated sequence.

## Features

- Generates a sequence of numbers based on user-defined starting point, difference, and maximum value.
- Calculates the sum of even numbers in the generated sequence.
- Efficiently handles large values of `a` (up to \(10^5\)).

## Input & Output

### Input

- `a`: Starting number of the sequence.
- `d`: Common difference between consecutive numbers.
- `b`: Maximum value for the sequence.

### Output

- Displays the generated sequence of numbers.
- Displays the sum of even numbers in the sequence.

### Example

#### Input: 

- `a`: 3
- `d`: 4
- `b`: 25
  
#### Output:

- Sequence: 3 7 11 15 19 23

- Sum of even numbers: 0
